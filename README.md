## Exploring NodeJS core modules and reinventing the wheel.##

In my experience it generally pays to reinvent the wheel in learning phase,
especially when it comes to design patterns and architecture. This repo is
reference code to my NodeJS posts on [Latent theory](http://latenttheory.in).

You can clone this repo and play with the code along the way.
I've kept each chapter in a separate branch. You can simply do

```
git checkout ch1
```
to access chapters. Following is the list of chapters.

* **ch1 Hello world program in NodeJS**
* **ch2 Building simple server**

I'll keep on adding chapters as we go on. Play around and keep
refining the code. Thanks. Happy Coding.
